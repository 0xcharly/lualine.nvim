### Terms/concepts in lualine
If you're coming from introduction, cool now you have lualine installed.
Maybe surprised why you can't see it.  Lualine doesn't self initialize itself .
It won't load itself unless you run `require'lualine'.setup()` . This means
there's no cost to having lualine installed it only does nothing unless user asks it to now what use see is lualine in it's default configuration. We'll
get into that in a moment.

I think it'll be best if we clear the terms used in lualine first so it's
easier to understand and doesn't leave you guessing what I mean
